## Description
This is the Python package for the **PDGenerator** Python library package that allows users to generate random variates from a wide range of probability distributions.  To use the library package, you can download it and import it in any Python script without a complicated installation process.

The PDGenerator package contains 4 files: 
1. PDGenerator.py
   1. Generate more than 15 types of random variables quickly and efficiently
   2. Require library: `math`.


2. GOFTester.py
   1. Contains goodness-of-fit tests for each type of random variable generated from PDGenerator.py.
   2. Require library: `numpy`, `scipy`.


3. plot.py
   1. Provides histograms from the random variables generated from PDGenerator.py.
   2. Require library: `numpy`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib`.


4. README.md.

## Installation
1. Download the zip file.

2. Install any library that you don't have in your environment 
```sh
pip install math
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install matplotlib
```
3. Create or open any Python script. 
   1. You need an integrated development environment (IDE) which able to run Python. Here are some options:
      1. VSCode - https://code.visualstudio.com/
      2. PyCharm - https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
      3. There are many more options.
   2. You may use the provided `GOFTester.py` or `plot.py` to test `PDGenerator.py`.

4. Place PDGenerator.py in the same file as your script and import it into the script. For example: 
```python
import PDGenerator as pdg
```

## How to run it 
Here are all the examples of generating random variants through PDGenerator.
### Set up random seed 
1. Once you have imported PDGenerator, you first need to set up a random seed 
by code 
```python
pd_generator = pdg.PDGenerator(seed=int)
```
   1. You may input any integer for the seed.
2. Then you are good to generate any random variant. 
### Examples

To generate uniform random variables,  run 
```python
pd_generator.unif(n=1, a=0, b=1)
```
* It returns a list of uniform random variables.
* n is the number of random variables that have been returned.
* a is the lower bound of the uniform random variables.
* b is the upper bound of the uniform random variables.

```python
pd_generator.disc_unif(n=1, a=0, b=1)
```

#### Triangular
To generate triangular random variables,  run 
```python
