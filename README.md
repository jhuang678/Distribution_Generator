# PDGenerator: Probability Distribution Generation Python Library Package
## Description
This is the python package for the **PDGenerator** Python library package that allows users to generate random variates from a wide range of probability distributions.  To use the library package, you can download it and import it in any python script without complicated installation process.

The pdGenerator package contains 4 files: 
1. PDGenerator.py
   1. Generate more than 15 types of random variables quickly and efficiently
   2. Require library:`math`.


2. GOFTester.py
   1. Contains goodness-of-fit tests for each type of random variable generated from PDGenerator.py.
   2. Require library:`numpy`, `scipy`.


3. plot.py
   1. Provides histograms from the random variables generated from PDGenerator.py.
   2. Require library:`numpy`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib`.


4. README.md.

## Installation
1. Download the zip file.

2. Install any library that you don't have in your environment 
```commandline
pip install math
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install matplotlib
```
3. Create or open any python script. 
   1. You need an integrated development environment (IDE) which able to run python. Here are some options:
      1. VSCode - https://code.visualstudio.com/
      2. PyCharm - https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
      3. There are many more options.
   2. You may use the provided `GOFTester.py` or `plot.py` to test `PDGenerator.py`.

4. Place PDGenerator.py in the same file with your script and import it in the script. For example: `import PDGenerator as pdg`

## How to run it 
Here are all the examples of generate random variant through PDGenerator.
### Set up random seed 
1. Once you have import PDGenerator, first you need to set up a random seed 
by code `pd_generator = pdg.PDGenerator(seed=int)`
   1. You may input any integer for the seed.
2. Then you are good to generate any random variant.
