## Abstract

RVGenerator is a Python library package that allows users to generate random variates from a wide range of probability distributions. With support for over 15 distributions, including Uniform(a,b), Triangular(a,b,c), Exponential(λ), Weibull (λ, β), Gamma(α,λ)/Erlang_n (λ), Chi-squared(n), Normal (μ, σ^2), Lognormal(µ,σ^2), Student's t(n), Bernoulli(p), Binomial(n,p), Geometric(p), Poisson (λ), RVGenerator is a versatile tool for simulation and modeling tasks in engineering and science. 

To ensure accuracy and reliability, the library uses well-established methods for generating pseudo-random variants and applying the Inverse Transform Theorem and Convolution Method to generate other distributed random variates. These methods are described in detail in *Simulation Modeling and Analysis, 5th (Law, 2015)* [1]. 

Additionally, all distributions in RVGenerator have been thoroughly tested using rigorous goodness of fit tests, including Chi-squared and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, and have passed with a 95% confidence level, confirming that the generated data conforms to the distribution defined by the user. 

Overall, RVGenerator is a valuable resource for anyone seeking to generate random variates from a range of probability distributions, with reliable results that have been rigorously tested and validated.

```

## How to run it 
Here are all the examples of generating random variants through PDGenerator.
### Set up random seed 
1. Once you have imported PDGenerator, you first need to set up a random seed 
by code 
```python
pd_generator = pdg.PDGenerator(seed=int)
```
   1. You may input any integer for the seed.
2. Then you are good to generate any random variant.

## Test Result

### Overall
To ensure the reliability and quality of the library, we performed rigorous testing, including multiple goodness of fit tests such as the Chi-squared and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, to verify that the generated data conforms to the distribution defined by the user.

### Single Test Result with 10,000 of random variants (n=10,000)
To test the accuracy of the generated data, we ran a single test with 10,000 random variants for each distribution. The Chi-squared or Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to validate the data with a 95% confidence interval (α=0.05). The RVGenerator’s random seed was set to 3 for all these single tests.

The null hypothesis is set \( H_0: X_1, X_2…X_{10,000} \) (i.i,d) ∼ pmf/pdf f(x).

*Test Result Summary Table*

| Distribution     | Chi-Squared Test | Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test | Other Goodness of Fit Test |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Unif(0,1)        | ACCEPT (p-value: 0.35)           | N/A                     | Correlation Test ACCEPT (p-value: 0.31 )         |

After the single test with 10,000 observations, all the random variables accepted the null hypothesis. However, for low p-value results, it is difficult to determine whether it is a bad generator or simply bad luck in a single test.

### 1000 Tests Result with 1000 of random variants (n=1000)
The purpose of testing 1000 of different random seed cases is to validate the stability of each random variant generating function. In this test, each type of distribution has generated 1,000 random variants for each test, and for each test I’m using different random seed from 4 to 1004. The acceptance rate is defined below:

The null hypothesis is set \( H_0: X_1, X_2…X_{1,000} \) (i.i,d) ∼ pmf/pdf f(x).

acceptance rate = (number of tests which ACCEPT \( H_0 \))/(The total number of tests) = (number of tests which ACCEPT \( H_0 \))/1000

*Acceptance Rate Summary Table*

| Distribution | Chi-Squared Test | Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test | Other Goodness of Fit Test |

|              | 99.9%            |                         |                           |

*Note: The table has been truncated for brevity.*

Based on the results of testing 1000 different random seed cases, the RVGenerator has been found to have high stability for generating a variety of random variables. The acceptance rate for each distribution is more or close to 95%, indicating that the null hypothesis of the Chi-Squared Test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, or other Goodness of Fit Test is accepted in most cases. This means that the generated random variables follow the expected probability distribution, which is a desirable characteristic of any random variable generator. Overall, these results suggest that the RVGenerator can be relied upon to generate random variables with a high degree of stability and accuracy.

(Note: In the Markdown format, the complex equations and special formatting such as subscript and italic are not represented as they would be in LaTeX, and the tables have been simplified. Additionally, due to the truncation of tables for brevity, not all the data is shown. The LaTeX notation for hypothesis testing does not have a direct representation in standard Markdown, so it has been represented using inline code formatting for the mathematical parts.)
